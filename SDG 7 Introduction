SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy focuses on ensuring access to reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. A critical problem within this goal is the lack of access to renewable energy in low-income areas, where many communities rely on non-renewable energy sources or lack energy infrastructure altogether. This problem contributes to environmental degradation and limits economic opportunities. Addressing this issue requires analyzing energy usage patterns, identifying areas with limited access, and implementing renewable energy projects that can provide sustainable solutions to underserved populations, improving both energy accessibility and environmental sustainability.
